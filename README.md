# ENISA-CTI-EU-2020
ENISA CTI-EU Conference held in Brussels on 30th 31st JAN 2020
During this talk I presented my view on STIX and its design and architecture and how it can be used beyond just a sharing standard. 
### Key takeaways:
- STIX has been through major changes since its inception and enhanced to map to real world CTI needs
- Don't forget that it is **customizable** & extendable – you can tailor it to your needs
- STIX is more than just a sharing standard
- File format (json) is just one small part of it
